Ongoing Maintainer's Tasks
##########################

..
  Much of the TBD content in this document should be answered when we come
  to consensus on https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COMM/pages/3545726977/Maintainer+Outstanding+Questions+9+14+meeting


This How-to will explain the ongoing tasks that Maintainers are expected to
perform, once their repositories are up to Open edX project standards (see
:doc:`maintain-a-repo`). These actions are performed periodically - some more
frequently than others - and are done to ensure your repository is consistently
up to date with the latest security fixes and the rest of the project's codebase.
Additionally, maintainers have a responsibility to the community to develop
transparently, respond to requests for help, and respond to proposals/PRs for
changes to the codebase.

To learn more about the Maintainer's Program, see `OEP-55`_.
