Exercise 3
##########

Let's improve the docs!

You can write a How-To!
***********************

#. Check out :ref:`how_to_template`

#. Then take a look at some `old operator docs`_.

#. Take some of the sections in the old docs and make replacements under: ``operators/how-tos``

.. _old operator docs: https://edx.readthedocs.io/projects/edx-installing-configuring-and-running/en/latest/configuration/index.html

You can review the existing docs!
*********************************

#. Go to https://docs.openedx.org

#. Browse the existing docs and find issues and suggest fixes!

You can explain something!
**************************

#. Think of an Open edX platform concept that you know well...or...at all!

#. See if there is an explaination of that concept in the developer or operator concepts.

   * :doc:`Developer Concepts </developers/concepts/index>`

   * :doc:`Operator Concepts </site_ops/concepts/index>`

#. Update or write a new concept doc!
